# Front-End Projects

## Introduction

This is a collection of front-end projects that I've built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. These projects are purely front-end, meaning they don't have a back-end component. They serve as a showcase of my skills and a resource for others who are learning front-end development.
